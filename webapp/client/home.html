    <h3>Abstract
  </h3>
    The emerging paradigm of Precision Oncology 3.0 uses panomics and sophisticated methods of statistical reverse engineering to hypothesize the putative networks that drive a given patient's tumour, and to attack these drivers with combinations of targeted therapies. Here, we review a paradigm termed <b><i>Rapid Learning</i></b> Precision Oncology wherein <b><i>every treatment event is considered as a probe</i></b> that simultaneously treats the patient and provides an opportunity to validate and refine the models on which the treatment decisions are based. Implementation of Rapid Learning Precision Oncology requires overcoming a host of challenges that include developing analytical tools, capturing the information from each patient encounter and rapidly extrapolating it to other patients, coordinating many patient encounters to efficiently search for effective treatments, and overcoming economic, social and structural impediments, such as obtaining access to, and reimbursement for, investigational drugs.
